FaceDrone
=========

using OpenFrameWorks to control a AR Drone 2.0 with OpenCV

Description
===========

I use [ofxArDrone](https://github.com/memo/ofxARDrone) to control the drone.
The video feed comes from [ofxStreamer](https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxStreamer), which I am adapting to a single AR Drone video stream addon, possible incorporated in the ofxArDrone addon.
The face detection is done via OpenCV using the [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) addon.
