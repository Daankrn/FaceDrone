FaceDrone
=========

using OpenFrameWorks to control a AR Drone 2.0 with OpenCV

Description
===========

I use [url=test.com]test[/url] to control the drone.
The video feed comes from ofxStreamer, which I am adapting to a single AR Drone streamer.
The face detection is done via OpenCV using the ofxCv addon.
